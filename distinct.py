# Write a function
# #
# # def solution(A)
# #
# # that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct values in array A.
# #
# # For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:
# #
# #  A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1
# #  A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1
# # the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.
# #
# # Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
# #
# # N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
# # each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].
